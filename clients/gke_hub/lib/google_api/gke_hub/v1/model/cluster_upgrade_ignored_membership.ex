  IgnoredMembership represents a membership ignored by the feature. A membership can be ignored because it was manually upgraded to a newer version than RC default.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ignoredTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Time when the membership was first set to ignored.
  *   `reason` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Reason why the membership is ignored.
