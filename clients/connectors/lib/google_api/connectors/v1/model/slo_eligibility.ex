defmodule GoogleApi.Connectors.V1.Model.SloEligibility do

  SloEligibility is a tuple containing eligibility value: true if an instance is eligible for SLO calculation or false if it should be excluded from all SLO-related calculations along with a user-defined reason.

  ## Attributes

  *   `eligible` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether an instance is eligible or ineligible.
  *   `reason` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - User-defined reason for the current value of instance eligibility. Usually, this can be directly mapped to the internal state. An empty reason is allowed.
