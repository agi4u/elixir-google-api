defmodule GoogleApi.Dataflow.V1b3.Model.HotKeyInfo do
  @moduledoc """
  Information about a hot key.

  ## Attributes

  *   `hotKeyAge` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The age of the hot key measured from when it was first detected.
  *   `key` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A detected hot key that is causing limited parallelism. This field will be populated only if the following flag is set to true: "--enable_hot_key_logging".
  *   `keyTruncated` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, then the above key is truncated and cannot be deserialized. This occurs if the key above is populated and the key size is >5MB.
