defmodule GoogleApi.AlloyDB.V1.Model.WeeklySchedule do
  @moduledoc """
  A weekly schedule starts a backup at prescribed start times within a day, for the specified days of the week. The weekly schedule message is flexible and can be used to create many types of schedules. For example, to have a daily backup that starts at 22:00, configure the `start_times` field to have one element "22:00" and the `days_of_week` field to have all seven days of the week.

  ## Attributes

  *   `daysOfWeek` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The days of the week to perform a backup. If this field is left empty, the default of every day of the week is used.
  *   `startTimes` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.AlloyDB.V1.Model.GoogleTypeTimeOfDay.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The times during the day to start a backup. The start times are assumed to be in UTC and to be an exact hour (e.g., 04:00:00). If no start times are provided, a single fixed start time is chosen arbitrarily.
