  ## Attributes

  *   `locationId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The numeric ID of a location that the shipping rate applies to as defined in the AdWords API.
  *   `maxHandlingTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum handling time (inclusive) between when the order is received and shipped in business days. 0 means that the order is shipped on the same day as it's received if it happens before the cut-off time. Both maxHandlingTime and maxTransitTime are required if providing shipping speeds.
  *   `maxTransitTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum transit time (inclusive) between when the order has shipped and when it's delivered in business days. 0 means that the order is delivered on the same day as it ships. Both maxHandlingTime and maxTransitTime are required if providing shipping speeds.
  *   `minHandlingTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Minimum handling time (inclusive) between when the order is received and shipped in business days. 0 means that the order is shipped on the same day as it's received if it happens before the cut-off time. minHandlingTime can only be present together with maxHandlingTime; but it's not required if maxHandlingTime is present.
  *   `minTransitTime` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Minimum transit time (inclusive) between when the order has shipped and when it's delivered in business days. 0 means that the order is delivered on the same day as it ships. minTransitTime can only be present together with maxTransitTime; but it's not required if maxTransitTime is present.
  *   `postalCode` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The postal code range that the shipping rate applies to, represented by a postal code, a postal code prefix followed by a * wildcard, a range between two postal codes or two postal code prefixes of equal length.
  *   `price` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Content.V21.Model.Price.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Fixed shipping price, represented as a number.
  *   `region` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The geographic region to which a shipping rate applies.
  *   `service` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A free-form description of the service class or delivery speed.
