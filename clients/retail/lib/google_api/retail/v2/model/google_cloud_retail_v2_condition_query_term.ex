  Query terms that we want to match on.

  ## Attributes

  *   `fullMatch` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether this is supposed to be a full or partial match.
  *   `value` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The value of the term to match on. Value cannot be empty. Value can have at most 3 terms if specified as a partial match. Each space separated string is considered as one term. For example, "a b c" is 3 terms and allowed, but " a b c d" is 4 terms and not allowed for a partial match.
