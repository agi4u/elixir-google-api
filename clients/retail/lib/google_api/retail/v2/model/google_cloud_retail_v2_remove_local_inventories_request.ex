defmodule GoogleApi.Retail.V2.Model.GoogleCloudRetailV2RemoveLocalInventoriesRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Request message for RemoveLocalInventories method.

  ## Attributes

  *   `allowMissing` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If set to true, and the Product is not found, the local inventory removal request will still be processed and retained for at most 1 day and processed once the Product is created. If set to false, a NOT_FOUND error is returned if the Product is not found.
  *   `placeIds` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A list of place IDs to have their inventory deleted. At most 3000 place IDs are allowed per request.
  *   `removeTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time when the inventory deletions are issued. Used to prevent out-of-order updates and deletions on local inventory fields. If not provided, the internal system time will be used.
