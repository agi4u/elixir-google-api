defmodule GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.ContentRestriction do
  @moduledoc """
  A restriction for accessing the content of the file.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ownerRestricted` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the content restriction can only be modified or removed by a user who owns the file. For files in shared drives, any user with `organizer` capabilities can modify or remove this content restriction.
  *   `readOnly` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether the content of the file is read-only. If a file is read-only, a new revision of the file may not be added, comments may not be added or modified, and the title of the file may not be modified.
  *   `reason` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Reason for why the content of the file is restricted. This is only mutable on requests that also set `readOnly=true`.
  *   `restrictingUser` (*type:* `GoogleApi.Drive.V3.Model.User.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The user who set the content restriction. Only populated if `readOnly` is true.
  *   `restrictionTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which the content restriction was set (formatted RFC 3339 timestamp). Only populated if readOnly is true.
  *   `systemRestricted` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Whether the content restriction was applied by the system, for example due to an esignature. Users cannot modify or remove system restricted content restrictions.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. The type of the content restriction. Currently the only possible value is `globalContentRestriction`.
