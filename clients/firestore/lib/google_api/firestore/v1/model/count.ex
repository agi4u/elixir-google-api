defmodule GoogleApi.Firestore.V1.Model.Count do
  @moduledoc """
  Count of documents that match the query. The `COUNT(*)` aggregation function operates on the entire document so it does not require a field reference.

  ## Attributes

  *   `upTo` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Optional constraint on the maximum number of documents to count. This provides a way to set an upper bound on the number of documents to scan, limiting latency and cost. High-Level Example: ``` SELECT COUNT_UP_TO(1000) FROM ( SELECT * FROM k ); ``` Requires: * Must be greater than zero when present.
