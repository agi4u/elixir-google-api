defmodule GoogleApi.HealthCare.V1beta1.Model.OperationMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  OperationMetadata provides information about the operation execution. Returned in the long-running operation's metadata field.

  ## Attributes

  *   `apiMethodName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the API method that initiated the operation.
  *   `cancelRequested` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Specifies if cancellation was requested for the operation.
  *   `counter` (*type:* `GoogleApi.HealthCare.V1beta1.Model.ProgressCounter.t`, *default:* `nil`) - 
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which the operation was created by the API.
  *   `endTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The time at which execution workloads were completed. Some tasks will complete after this time such as logging audit logs.
  *   `logsUrl` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A link to audit and error logs in the log viewer. Error logs are generated only by some operations, listed at [Viewing error logs in Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/healthcare/docs/how-tos/logging). The `end_time` specified in this URL may not match the end time on the metadata because logs are written asynchronously from execution.
