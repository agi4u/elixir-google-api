  Fields that don't match a KeepField or CleanTextField `action` in the BASIC profile are collected into a contextual phrase list. For fields that match a CleanTextField `action` in FieldMetadata or ProfileType, the process attempts to transform phrases matching these contextual entries. These contextual phrases are replaced with the token "[CTX]". This feature uses an additional InfoType during inspection.
