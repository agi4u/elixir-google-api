  Device context associated with the object.

  ## Attributes

  *   `deviceToken` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - If set, redemption information will only be returned to the given device upon activation of the object. This should not be used as a stable identifier to trace a user's device. It can change across different passes for the same device or even across different activations for the same device. When setting this, callers must also set has_linked_device on the object being activated.
