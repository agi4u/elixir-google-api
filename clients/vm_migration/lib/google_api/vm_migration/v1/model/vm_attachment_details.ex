  *   `deviceName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Specifies a unique device name of your choice that is reflected into the /dev/disk/by-id/google-* tree of a Linux operating system running within the instance. If not specified, the server chooses a default device name to apply to this disk, in the form persistent-disk-x, where x is a number assigned by Google Compute Engine. This field is only applicable for persistent disks.
