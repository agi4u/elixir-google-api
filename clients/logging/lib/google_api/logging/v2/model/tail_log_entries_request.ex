defmodule GoogleApi.Logging.V2.Model.TailLogEntriesRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The parameters to TailLogEntries.

  ## Attributes

  *   `bufferWindow` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The amount of time to buffer log entries at the server before being returned to prevent out of order results due to late arriving log entries. Valid values are between 0-60000 milliseconds. Defaults to 2000 milliseconds.
  *   `filter` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Only log entries that match the filter are returned. An empty filter matches all log entries in the resources listed in resource_names. Referencing a parent resource that is not listed in resource_names will cause the filter to return no results. The maximum length of a filter is 20,000 characters.
  *   `resourceNames` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Name of a parent resource from which to retrieve log entries: projects/[PROJECT_ID] organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID] billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID] folders/[FOLDER_ID]May alternatively be one or more views: projects/[PROJECT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID] organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID] billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID] folders/[FOLDER_ID]/locations/[LOCATION_ID]/buckets/[BUCKET_ID]/views/[VIEW_ID]
