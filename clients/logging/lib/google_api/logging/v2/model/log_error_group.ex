  Contains metadata that associates the LogEntry to Error Reporting error groups.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The id is a unique identifier for a particular error group; it is the last part of the error group resource name: /project/[PROJECT_ID]/errors/[ERROR_GROUP_ID]. Example: COShysOX0r_51QE. The id is derived from key parts of the error-log content and is treated as Service Data. For information about how Service Data is handled, see Google Cloud Privacy Notice (https://cloud.google.com/terms/cloud-privacy-notice).
