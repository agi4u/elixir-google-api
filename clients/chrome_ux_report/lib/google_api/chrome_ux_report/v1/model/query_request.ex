  *   `effectiveConnectionType` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The effective connection type is a query dimension that specifies the effective network class that the record's data should belong to. This field uses the values ["offline", "slow-2G", "2G", "3G", "4G"] as specified in: https://wicg.github.io/netinfo/#effective-connection-types Note: If no effective connection type is specified, then a special record with aggregated data over all effective connection types will be returned.
  *   `formFactor` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The form factor is a query dimension that specifies the device class that the record's data should belong to. Note: If no form factor is specified, then a special record with aggregated data over all form factors will be returned.
  *   `metrics` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - The metrics that should be included in the response. If none are specified then any metrics found will be returned. Allowed values: ["first_contentful_paint", "first_input_delay", "largest_contentful_paint", "cumulative_layout_shift"]
  *   `origin` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The url pattern "origin" refers to a url pattern that is the origin of a website. Examples: "https://example.com", "https://cloud.google.com"
