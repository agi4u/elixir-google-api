  @moduledoc """
  An explanation method that redistributes Integrated Gradients attributions to segmented regions, taking advantage of the model's fully differentiable structure. Refer to this paper for more details: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02825 Only supports image Models (modality is IMAGE).

  ## Attributes

  *   `stepCount` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - The number of steps for approximating the path integral. A good value to start is 50 and gradually increase until the sum to diff property is met within the desired error range. Valid range of its value is [1, 100], inclusively.
