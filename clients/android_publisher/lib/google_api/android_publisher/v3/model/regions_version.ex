defmodule GoogleApi.AndroidPublisher.V3.Model.RegionsVersion do
  @moduledoc """
  The version of the available regions being used for the specified resource.

  ## Attributes

  *   `version` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. A string representing the version of available regions being used for the specified resource. Regional prices for the resource have to be specified according to the information published in [this article](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10532353). Each time the supported locations substantially change, the version will be incremented. Using this field will ensure that creating and updating the resource with an older region's version and set of regional prices and currencies will succeed even though a new version is available. The latest version is 2022/02.
