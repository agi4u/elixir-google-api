  ## Attributes

  *   `destinations` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.NetworkServices.V1.Model.TlsRouteRouteDestination.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The destination services to which traffic should be forwarded. At least one destination service is required.
  *   `idleTimeout` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Specifies the idle timeout for the selected route.
