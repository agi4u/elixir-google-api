  Option to specify health based failover behavior. This is not related to Network load balancer FailoverPolicy.

  ## Attributes

  *   `failoverHealthThreshold` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The percentage threshold that a load balancer will begin to send traffic to failover backends. If the percentage of endpoints in a MIG/NEG is smaller than this value, traffic would be sent to failover backends if possible. This field should be set to a value between 1 and 99. The default value is 50 for Global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic) and Proxyless service mesh, and 70 for others.
