  The list of per-targeting-dimension targeting settings.

  ## Attributes

  *   `bidOnly` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates whether to restrict your ads to show only for the criteria you have selected for this targeting_dimension, or to target all values for this targeting_dimension and show ads based on your targeting in other TargetingDimensions. A value of `true` means that these criteria will only apply bid modifiers, and not affect targeting. A value of `false` means that these criteria will restrict targeting as well as applying bid modifiers.
  *   `targetingDimension` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The targeting dimension that these settings apply to.
