  The bucket's soft delete policy, which defines the period of time that soft-deleted objects will be retained, and cannot be permanently deleted.

  ## Attributes

  *   `effectiveTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Server-determined value that indicates the time from which the policy, or one with a greater retention, was effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format.
  *   `retentionDurationSeconds` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The duration in seconds that soft-deleted objects in the bucket will be retained and cannot be permanently deleted.
