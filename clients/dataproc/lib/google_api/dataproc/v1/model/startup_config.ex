  Configuration to handle the startup of instances during cluster create and update process.

  ## Attributes

  *   `requiredRegistrationFraction` (*type:* `float()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The config setting to enable cluster creation/ updation to be successful only after required_registration_fraction of instances are up and running. This configuration is applicable to only secondary workers for now. The cluster will fail if required_registration_fraction of instances are not available.
