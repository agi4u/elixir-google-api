  *   `maxFailuresPerHour` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Maximum number of times per hour a driver can be restarted as a result of driver exiting with non-zero code before job is reported failed.A job might be reported as thrashing if the driver exits with a non-zero code four times within a 10-minute window.Maximum value is 10.Note: This restartable job option is not supported in Dataproc workflow templates (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/workflows/using-workflows#adding_jobs_to_a_template).
  *   `maxFailuresTotal` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Maximum total number of times a driver can be restarted as a result of the driver exiting with a non-zero code. After the maximum number is reached, the job will be reported as failed.Maximum value is 240.Note: Currently, this restartable job option is not supported in Dataproc workflow templates (https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/workflows/using-workflows#adding_jobs_to_a_template).
