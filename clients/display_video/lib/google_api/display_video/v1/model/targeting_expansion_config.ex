defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V1.Model.TargetingExpansionConfig do
  @moduledoc """
  Settings that control the [optimized targeting](//support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12060859) settings of the line item.

  ## Attributes

  *   `excludeFirstPartyAudience` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Whether to exclude first-party audiences from use in targeting expansion. This field was deprecated with the launch of [optimized targeting](//support.google.com/displayvideo/answer/12060859). This field will be set to `false`. If this field is set to `true` when deprecated, all positive first-party audience targeting assigned to this line item will be replaced with negative targeting of the same first-party audiences to ensure the continued exclusion of those audiences.
  *   `targetingExpansionLevel` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Whether optimized targeting is turned on. This field supports the following values: * `NO_EXPANSION`: optimized targeting is turned off * `LEAST_EXPANSION`: optimized targeting is turned on If this field is set to any other value, it will automatically be set to `LEAST_EXPANSION`. `NO_EXPANSION` will be the default value for the field and will be automatically assigned if you do not set the field.
