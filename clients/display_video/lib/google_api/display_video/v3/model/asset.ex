defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.Asset do
  @moduledoc """
  A single asset.

  ## Attributes

  *   `content` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The asset content. For uploaded assets, the content is the serving path.
  *   `mediaId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Media ID of the uploaded asset. This is a unique identifier for the asset. This ID can be passed to other API calls, e.g. CreateCreative to associate the asset with a creative. The Media ID space updated on **April 5, 2023**. Update media IDs cached before **April 5, 2023** by retrieving the new media ID from associated creative resources or re-uploading the asset.
