defmodule GoogleApi.DisplayVideo.V3.Model.AgeRangeAssignedTargetingOptionDetails do
  @moduledoc """
  Represents a targetable age range. This will be populated in the details field of an AssignedTargetingOption when targeting_type is `TARGETING_TYPE_AGE_RANGE`.

  ## Attributes

  *   `ageRange` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The age range of an audience. We only support targeting a continuous age range of an audience. Thus, the age range represented in this field can be 1) targeted solely, or, 2) part of a larger continuous age range. The reach of a continuous age range targeting can be expanded by also targeting an audience of an unknown age.
