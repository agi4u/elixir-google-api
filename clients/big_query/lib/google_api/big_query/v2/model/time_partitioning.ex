  ## Attributes

  *   `expirationMs` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for a partition. A wrapper is used here because 0 is an invalid value.
  *   `field` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column '_PARTITIONTIME'; if set, the table is partitioned by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field. Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED. A wrapper is used here because an empty string is an invalid value.
  *   `requirePartitionFilter` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `false`) - If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified. This field is deprecated; please set the field with the same name on the table itself instead. This field needs a wrapper because we want to output the default value, false, if the user explicitly set it.
  *   `type` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. The supported types are DAY, HOUR, MONTH, and YEAR, which will generate one partition per day, hour, month, and year, respectively.
