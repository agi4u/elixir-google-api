  ## Attributes

  *   `dataMaskingApplied` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `false`) - [Output-only] [Preview] Whether any accessed data was protected by data masking. The actual evaluation is done by accessStats.masked_field_count > 0. Since this is only used for the discovery_doc generation purpose, as long as the type (boolean) matches, client library can leverage this. The actual evaluation of the variable is done else-where.
