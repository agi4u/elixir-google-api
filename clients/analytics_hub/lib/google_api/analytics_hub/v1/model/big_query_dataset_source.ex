  A reference to a shared dataset. It is an existing BigQuery dataset with a collection of objects such as tables and views that you want to share with subscribers. When subscriber's subscribe to a listing, Analytics Hub creates a linked dataset in the subscriber's project. A Linked dataset is an opaque, read-only BigQuery dataset that serves as a _symbolic link_ to a shared dataset.

  ## Attributes

  *   `dataset` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Resource name of the dataset source for this listing. e.g. `projects/myproject/datasets/123`
