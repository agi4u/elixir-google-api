defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.ContextualAddOnMarkup do
  @moduledoc """
  The markup for developers to specify the contents of a contextual AddOn. A contextual AddOn is triggered in context of an email. For that email, there can be N items that are associated with the email (e.g. contacts, sales lead, meeting information). Each item is represented as a "card". A card has two views, collapsed and detailed. If there are more than 1 card, the cards are show as a list of collapsed views. The end user can expand into the detailed view for each of those cards. In the detailed view, developers have the freedom to use a variety of "widgets" to construct it. The model here is to restrict (make consistent for end users) the navigation of the N cards but providing developers the freedom to build the detailed view that can best represent their use case/content. Go http://go/aoig-widgets1 to see the mocks. Post v1, we plan to support new AddOn use cases that will require different and separate 'templates'. For example, a compose triggered AddOn which will support a new set of use cases with different user interaction patterns. As a result, we will likely need a very different template than this one.
