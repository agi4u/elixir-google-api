defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.AuthorizedItemId do
  @moduledoc """
  A combination of an identifier for a Drive resource (e.g. file, folder, or drive) and any secrets needed to access it. The secrets should never be logged, and this proto annotates those secret fields to ensure that they are not. Clients are encouraged to use this proto rather than defining their own, to ensure that secrets are correctly annotated.

  ## Attributes

  *   `id` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Serialized ID of the Drive resource
  *   `resourceKey` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Resource key of the Drive item. This field should be unset if, depending on the context, the item does not have a resource key, or if none was specified. This must never be logged.
