defmodule GoogleApi.CloudSearch.V1.Model.TextOperatorOptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Used to provide a search operator for text properties. This is optional. Search operators let users restrict the query to specific fields relevant to the type of item being searched.

  ## Attributes

  *   `exactMatchWithOperator` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - If true, the text value is tokenized as one atomic value in operator searches and facet matches. For example, if the operator name is "genre" and the value is "science-fiction" the query restrictions "genre:science" and "genre:fiction" doesn't match the item; "genre:science-fiction" does. Text value matching is case-sensitive and does not remove special characters. If false, the text is tokenized. For example, if the value is "science-fiction" the queries "genre:science" and "genre:fiction" matches the item.
  *   `operatorName` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates the operator name required in the query in order to isolate the text property. For example, if operatorName is *subject* and the property's name is *subjectLine*, then queries like *subject:<value>* show results only where the value of the property named *subjectLine* matches *<value>*. By contrast, a search that uses the same *<value>* without an operator returns all items where *<value>* matches the value of any text properties or text within the content field for the item. The operator name can only contain lowercase letters (a-z). The maximum length is 32 characters.
