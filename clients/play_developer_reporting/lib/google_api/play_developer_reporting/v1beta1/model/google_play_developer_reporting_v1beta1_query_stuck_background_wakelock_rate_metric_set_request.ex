  ## Attributes

  *   `dimensions` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Dimensions to slice the data by. **Supported dimensions:** * `apiLevel` (string): the API level of Android that was running on the user's device. * `versionCode` (int64): version of the app that was running on the user's device. * `deviceModel` (string): unique identifier of the user's device model. * `deviceType` (string): the type (also known as form factor) of the user's device. * `countryCode` (string): the country or region of the user's device based on their IP address, represented as a 2-letter ISO-3166 code (e.g. US for the United States). * `deviceRamBucket` (int64): RAM of the device, in MB, in buckets (3GB, 4GB, etc.). * `deviceSocMake` (string): Make of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., Samsung. [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MANUFACTURER) * `deviceSocModel` (string): Model of the device's primary system-on-chip, e.g., "Exynos 2100". [Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build#SOC_MODEL) * `deviceCpuMake` (string): Make of the device's CPU, e.g., Qualcomm. * `deviceCpuModel` (string): Model of the device's CPU, e.g., "Kryo 240". * `deviceGpuMake` (string): Make of the device's GPU, e.g., ARM. * `deviceGpuModel` (string): Model of the device's GPU, e.g., Mali. * `deviceGpuVersion` (string): Version of the device's GPU, e.g., T750. * `deviceVulkanVersion` (string): Vulkan version of the device, e.g., "4198400". * `deviceGlEsVersion` (string): OpenGL ES version of the device, e.g., "196610". * `deviceScreenSize` (string): Screen size of the device, e.g., NORMAL, LARGE. * `deviceScreenDpi` (string): Screen density of the device, e.g., mdpi, hdpi.
  *   `filter` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Filters to apply to data. The filtering expression follows [AIP-160](https://google.aip.dev/160) standard and supports filtering by equality of all breakdown dimensions.
  *   `metrics` (*type:* `list(String.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Metrics to aggregate. **Supported metrics:** * `stuckBgWakelockRate` (`google.type.Decimal`): Percentage of distinct users in the aggregation period that had a wakelock held in the background for longer than 1 hour. If your app exhibits a stuck background wakelock rate equal to or higher than the threshold, it's in the bottom 25% of the top 1,000 apps on Google Play (by number of installs). * `stuckBgWakelockRate7dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 7 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `stuckBgWakelockRate28dUserWeighted` (`google.type.Decimal`): Rolling average value of `stuckBgWakelockRate` in the last 28 days. The daily values are weighted by the count of distinct users for the day. * `distinctUsers` (`google.type.Decimal`): Count of distinct users in the aggregation period that were used as normalization value for the `stuckBgWakelockRate` metric. A user is counted in this metric if they app was doing any work on the device, i.e., not just active foreground usage but also background work. Care must be taken not to aggregate this count further, as it may result in users being counted multiple times.
  *   `pageSize` (*type:* `integer()`, *default:* `nil`) - Maximum size of the returned data. If unspecified, at most 1000 rows will be returned. The maximum value is 100000; values above 100000 will be coerced to 100000.
  *   `pageToken` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - A page token, received from a previous call. Provide this to retrieve the subsequent page. When paginating, all other parameters provided to the request must match the call that provided the page token.
  *   `timelineSpec` (*type:* `GoogleApi.PlayDeveloperReporting.V1beta1.Model.GooglePlayDeveloperReportingV1beta1TimelineSpec.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Specification of the timeline aggregation parameters. **Supported aggregation periods:** * DAILY: metrics are aggregated in calendar date intervals. Due to historical constraints, the only supported timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`.
