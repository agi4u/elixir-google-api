defmodule GoogleApi.ArtifactRegistry.V1.Model.UploadGenericArtifactRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  The request to upload a generic artifact. The created GenericArtifact will have the resource name {parent}/genericArtifacts/package_id:version_id. The created file will have the resource name {parent}/files/package_id:version_id:filename.

  ## Attributes

  *   `filename` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The name of the file of the generic artifact to be uploaded. E.g. "example-file.zip" The filename should only include letters, numbers, and url safe characters, i.e. [a-zA-Z0-9-_.~@].
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Deprecated. Use package_id, version_id and filename instead. The resource name of the generic artifact. E.g. "projects/math/locations/us/repositories/operations/genericArtifacts/addition/1.0.0/add.py"
  *   `packageId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the package of the generic artifact. If the package does not exist, a new package will be created. E.g. "pkg-1" The package_id must start with a letter, end with a letter or number, only contain letters, numbers, hyphens and periods i.e. [a-z0-9-.], and cannot exceed 256 characters.
  *   `versionId` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The ID of the version of the generic artifact. If the version does not exist, a new version will be created. E.g."1.0.0" The version_id must start and end with a letter or number, can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and periods, i.e. [a-z0-9-.] and cannot exceed a total of 128 characters. While "latest" is a well-known name for the latest version of a package, it is not yet supported and is reserved for future use. Creating a version called "latest" is not allowed.
