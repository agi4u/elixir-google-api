  ReleaseReadyCondition contains information around the status of the Release. If a release is not ready, you cannot create a rollout with the release.

  ## Attributes

  *   `status` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - True if the Release is in a valid state. Otherwise at least one condition in `ReleaseCondition` is in an invalid state. Iterate over those conditions and see which condition(s) has status = false to find out what is wrong with the Release.
