defmodule GoogleApi.CloudDeploy.V1.Model.Automation do
  @moduledoc """
  An `Automation` resource in the Cloud Deploy API. An `Automation` enables the automation of manually driven actions for a Delivery Pipeline, which includes Release promotion among Targets, Rollout repair and Rollout deployment strategy advancement. The intention of Automation is to reduce manual intervention in the continuous delivery process.

  ## Attributes

  *   `annotations` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. User annotations. These attributes can only be set and used by the user, and not by Cloud Deploy. Annotations must meet the following constraints: * Annotations are key/value pairs. * Valid annotation keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). * The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. * The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots(`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/#syntax-and-character-set for more details.
  *   `createTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Time at which the automation was created.
  *   `description` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Description of the `Automation`. Max length is 255 characters.
  *   `etag` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. The weak etag of the `Automation` resource. This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
  *   `labels` (*type:* `map()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Labels are attributes that can be set and used by both the user and by Cloud Deploy. Labels must meet the following constraints: * Keys and values can contain only lowercase letters, numeric characters, underscores, and dashes. * All characters must use UTF-8 encoding, and international characters are allowed. * Keys must start with a lowercase letter or international character. * Each resource is limited to a maximum of 64 labels. Both keys and values are additionally constrained to be <= 63 characters.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Name of the `Automation`. Format is `projects/{project}/locations/{location}/deliveryPipelines/{delivery_pipeline}/automations/{automation}`.
  *   `rules` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.CloudDeploy.V1.Model.AutomationRule.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. List of Automation rules associated with the Automation resource. Must have at least one rule and limited to 250 rules per Delivery Pipeline. Note: the order of the rules here is not the same as the order of execution.
  *   `selector` (*type:* `GoogleApi.CloudDeploy.V1.Model.AutomationResourceSelector.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Selected resources to which the automation will be applied.
  *   `serviceAccount` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Required. Email address of the user-managed IAM service account that creates Cloud Deploy release and rollout resources.
  *   `suspended` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. When Suspended, automation is deactivated from execution.
  *   `uid` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Unique identifier of the `Automation`.
  *   `updateTime` (*type:* `DateTime.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Output only. Time at which the automation was updated.
