defmodule GoogleApi.Chat.V1.Model.GoogleAppsCardV1Action do
  @moduledoc """
  An action that describes the behavior when the form is submitted. For example, an Apps Script can be invoked to handle the form.

  ## Attributes

  *   `function` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Apps Script function to invoke when the containing element is clicked/activated.
  *   `interaction` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Optional. Required when opening a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). What to do in response to an interaction with a user, such as a user clicking button on a card message. If unspecified, the app responds by executing an `action` - like opening a link or running a function - as normal. By specifying an `interaction`, the app can respond in special interactive ways. For example, by setting `interaction` to `OPEN_DIALOG`, the app can open a [dialog](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/dialogs). When specified, a loading indicator is not shown. Supported by Chat apps, but not Google Workspace Add-ons. If specified for an add-on, the entire card is stripped and nothing is shown in the client.
  *   `loadIndicator` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Specifies the loading indicator that the action displays while making the call to the action.
  *   `parameters` (*type:* `list(GoogleApi.Chat.V1.Model.GoogleAppsCardV1ActionParameter.t)`, *default:* `nil`) - List of action parameters.
  *   `persistValues` (*type:* `boolean()`, *default:* `nil`) - Indicates whether form values persist after the action. The default value is `false`. If `true`, form values remain after the action is triggered. When using [LoadIndicator.NONE](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for actions, `persist_values` = `true`is recommended, as it ensures that any changes made by the user after form or on change actions are sent to the server are not overwritten by the response. If `false`, the form values are cleared when the action is triggered. When `persist_values` is set to `false`, it is strongly recommended that the card use [LoadIndicator.SPINNER](https://developers.google.com/workspace/add-ons/reference/rpc/google.apps.card.v1#loadindicator) for all actions, as this locks the UI to ensure no changes are made by the user while the action is being processed. Not supported by Google Chat apps.
